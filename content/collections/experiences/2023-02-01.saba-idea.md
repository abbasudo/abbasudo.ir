As a Contract Software Engineer at Saba Idea, I embraced the opportunity to pivot my career path entirely through remote work. In response to company needs, I expanded my skills in web scraping, developing efficient Python scripts to extract data from Telegram. Using Laravel, I crafted a user-friendly dashboard to present the crawled data.
