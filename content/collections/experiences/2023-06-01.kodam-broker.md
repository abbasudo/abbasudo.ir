I expaned my expertise in Nuxt.js while leading the development of a new web application (MVP version). I not only helped the creation of both admin and client panels using Nuxt.js, but also played a pivotal role in mentoring an intermediate developer in mastering Laravel, enhancing our team's overall skill set and project delivery efficiency.
