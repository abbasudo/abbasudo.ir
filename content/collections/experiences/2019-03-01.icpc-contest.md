ICPC contests are a challenging but rewarding aspect of the programming world, sparking my interest due to their complexity and competitive nature. Over the years, I have seized every opportunity to participate, marking my presence in 2019, 2021, and 2023. Each participation tested my abilities and allowed me to expand my knowledge of programming, algorithms, and teamwork. Engaging in these contests whenever I found the time and opportunity has significantly contributed to my professional and personal growth in the field. I loved this part of my life but I don't think I can participate anymore.
