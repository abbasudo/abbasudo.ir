At Tribes Agency, I worked as a Laravel developer, where I maintained and added new features to a time-tracking platform. I used technologies like Laravel Tenancy to manage multi-tenant systems and GraphQL to create efficient APIs. Some of my accomplishments include improving system performance and adding features that enhanced the user experience. This position helped me deepen my knowledge of Laravel and build reliable, user-friendly software.
