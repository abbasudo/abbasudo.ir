I contributed to "Pulse Users," a neat open-source PHP package that sits on top of Laravel Pulse Dashboard, adding an Hourly Distributed Requests Chart. It's all about giving a clear picture of traffic flow, making life easier for DevOps and SysAdmins. My dive into Laravel and PHP made this fun feature possible, blending seamlessly into the dashboard and shining a light on how to balance loads better and keep things running smoothly.
