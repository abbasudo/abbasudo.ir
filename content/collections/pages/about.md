# Hi there, <span class="whitespace-nowrap">I'm Abbas Mkhzomi.</span>

I've been making computers do my bidding for over 4 years. I've done everything from creating web applications to building the servers they run on. I mostly build with Laravel, Nuxt, FastAPI and Docker.

Some interesting projects I've worked on include:

* A printing office management system
* AI IELTS examiner bot 
* A cryptocurrency trading robot
* Diet planning website
* A learing manegment system 

I care deeply about open-source software, best practices, open standards, and great user and developer experiences.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy Movies, billiard, hangin out with friends, rap music and gaming.
